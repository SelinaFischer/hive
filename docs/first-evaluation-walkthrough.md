# First Evaluation Walkthrough

## When to use this walkthrough

This guide is intended for users who have completed Quickstart and want a simple way to validate that their Hive environment is working correctly and to understand how agents behave during execution.

While the existing documentation explains setup and architecture clearly, this walkthrough focuses specifically on helping users evaluate behaviour, interpret results, and build confidence that the system is working as intended before moving on to more complex workflows.

If you have not completed installation and setup, start with:

- Quickstart  
- Getting Started  

---

## Purpose

This walkthrough demonstrates a simple way to evaluate Hive after setup by running an agent, observing behaviour, and verifying expected results.

The goal is to:

- confirm the environment works correctly  
- understand execution behaviour  
- observe logs and outputs  
- experiment with small changes  

---

## Example Scenario

Run one of the sample agents provided in the repository and observe:

- execution logs  
- outputs  
- behaviour when modifying inputs or goals  

This scenario is intentionally simple and focused on understanding behaviour rather than building a production workflow.

---

## Steps

1. Complete Quickstart and ensure the environment is running.

2. Run one of the sample agents from the examples or Quickstart instructions.

3. Observe the following:

   - execution logs  
   - outputs  
   - runtime behaviour  

4. Modify a small parameter:
   - change input text  
   - adjust a goal  
   - change a simple configuration  

5. Run again and observe differences in behaviour or outputs.

---

## What success looks like

You should be able to:

- run an agent without errors  
- see outputs generated  
- observe execution logs  
- see behaviour change when inputs change  


If these steps work, your environment and execution flow are functioning correctly.

## What to try next

After completing this walkthrough, you may want to:

- explore Outcome-Driven Development examples  
- experiment with more complex agent graphs  
- add tools or functions to agents
